# Book-Diary
At one point few years back, I stopped reading as much as I did in the past,the books weren't just seeming to keep my attention. Reading seemed like a real strugle. Beginning of this year I decided to get back on track, and read as much books as I can. Acquiring the Kindle seemed to have re-lit the reading spark in me. I've set the goal loosely to 2 books a month. So far sometimes I'm over, sometimes under this goal. 
This being my first GitHub repository, probably not used in a way meant to, is just a way of record keeping on what had I read so far, and keeping track of overall progress, and generally introduce myself in an unconventional way.
