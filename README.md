# Book-Diary  

At one point few years back, I stopped reading as much as I did in the past, as the books weren't just being able to keep my attention. Reading seemed like a real struggle. Beginning of this year I decided to get back on track, and read as much books as I can, and acquiring the Kindle seemed to have re-lit the reading spark in me. I've set the goal loosely to 2 books a month. So far sometimes I'm over, sometimes under this goal, but reading is fun once again.  

This being my first GitHub repository, this being written initially in 2017, and probably not used in a way originally meant to be used, is just a way of keeping record on what I had read so far, keeping track of overall progress and eventual change in my affinities, and generally introducing myself in an unconventional way, through the books read.  

Come year 2022, I enrolled Master Studies - Master in Computational Studies, which sort of pushed me again to delve into new area and to continue reading more. Learning Python & R, appart from refreshing knowledge in the Statistics and Financial Math. So reading is fun once again.
